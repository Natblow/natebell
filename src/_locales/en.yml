    testimonial: Testimonial
    first_testimonial: >-
      Nathan is a very curious and eager developer, always looking for ways to improve himself.
      He isn't afraid to look for feedback and suggestions to improve himself or the code
      he is writing, he never takes it personally and applies it to whatever he is working on.
      I was especially impressed with the amount of initiative he has taken going out of his way
      to find mentorship, and opportunities to improve himself, on his own. 
      If you're looking for a developer that is self-motivated, consistent, 
      has a strong "growth mindset", and ready to grow alongside you, Nathan 
      is an excellent choice!
